# React Hook & API Practice

# About
This was a fun project to do while learning more about React and its capabilities. The purpose of this project was to understand and implement the use of the hooks useState & useEffect, axios, and as well as utilize fundamental knowledge of APIs and interacting with APIs using react. For this simple application, I chose the pokemon API to simply show all pokemon in the database. This application will allow the user to view and search all pokemon.
